# TaxiOkay

**Goals**

Taxi Okay! it's an application developed for Android whose purpose is to be able to help both the taxi user community and the drivers themselves, verifying the taxi's reliability and legality. This will reduce the number of so-called pirate taxis, as well as violence and insecurity by increasing user confidence. This will be achieved through the development of an Android application, which will provide the taxi's and driver's information through a QR code, license plate or taxi number. In addition to this you will have personal security options, like reporting the taxi and send information to your trusted contacts.

**Scope**

At this moment we plan to delimit it's functionality to Cancun, since in the last months there has been a wave of violence related to taxis, in addition to the fact that there are no alternatives like Uber.
This project has great potential for expansion to other cities since this is a common problem everywhere.
The product will be an app that can verify the legality of the taxi through a QR code, plate number or taxi number.
